Cassandra is an open source Monte Carlo package developed in the Maginn group at
the University of Notre Dame to perform atomistic simulations of molecules
composed of rings, chains, or both. Cassandra is suited to compute the
thermodynamic properties of fluids and phase equilibria. It handles a standard
"Class I"-type force field having fixed bond lengths. Cassandra uses OpenMP
parallelization and comes with a number of scripts, utilities and examples to
help with simulation setup. It is released under the GNU General Public License.
